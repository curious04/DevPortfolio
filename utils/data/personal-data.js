With joining lots of hackathons, I've gained a bunch of skills and improved my problem solving skills.

I am a quick learner with a self-learning attitude. I love to learn and explore new technologies and am passionate about problem-solving. I am available for any kind of job opportunity that suits my skills and interests.",
